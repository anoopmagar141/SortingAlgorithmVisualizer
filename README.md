This code creates an interactive visualizer for sorting algorithms using Tkinter and matplotlib. Here's how it works:

# GUI Setup with Tkinter: The program creates a user interface with buttons and a dropdown menu for selecting sorting algorithms.

# Generate Random Data: A random list of integers is generated and displayed as a bar chart.

# Sorting Algorithms:
*Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they're in the wrong order.
*Insertion Sort: Places each element in its correct position in the sorted part of the list.
*Quick Sort: Recursively divides and sorts the data.

# Real-time Visualization: matplotlib is used to visually display the data as bars.

# Color Highlights:
*Red: Elements being compared or swapped.
*Green: Sorted elements.
*Dynamic Updates: The bar chart updates step-by-step during the sorting process, allowing the user to see how the algorithm works in real time.

#User Interaction: The user can select an algorithm from the dropdown and press a button to start the sorting process.
